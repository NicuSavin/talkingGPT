# TalkGPT

TalkGPT is a browser extension that enables users to engage in voice-based interactions with Chat GPT. It facilitates asking questions and sending messages via voice commands, and also allows for receiving responses audibly.

1. Download the extension package from this GitHub repository.
2. Extract the package to a preferred location on your computer.
3. Launch your browser and navigate to the extensions page.
4. Enable 'Developer Mode' if it isn't already active.
5. Click on the "Load unpacked" button and navigate to the directory where you extracted the extension package.
6. Once selected, the extension should be installed and ready for use.

## How Does It Work?

TalkGPT extension introduces a small control panel below the question bar of ChatGPT.

The control panel includes a 'send keyword' feature; when this keyword or phrase is spoken, your current message will be sent to ChatGPT. Any words spoken after the 'send keyword' will be disregarded.

The control panel includes three buttons:

- **Mic Button:** This button toggles the microphone recording function. When activated, its color changes to red, and your spoken words are transcribed and populated in the question bar. Deactivating the button stops the recording and returns the button to its original color. While this button is activated, it will continue to listen until you stop speaking, at which point it will automatically deactivate itself.

- **Auto Button:** This button activates the auto microphone function. When in 'auto' mode, the microphone will continuously record, regardless of whether you have stopped speaking.

- **Sound Button:** This button controls the auditory response functionality of ChatGPT. When activated, ChatGPT will read responses out loud. When deactivated, ChatGPT will only provide text responses. Please note that this feature is still in development.

## Limitations

Please note that the extension currently only supports the English language. Further updates for additional language support may be released in future iterations.
