**TalkGPT**
TalkGPT is a browser extension that allows the user to have a voice conversation with Chat GPT. It allows for asking and sending messages with your voice, also receiving the answers in oral form as well.

**Installation**

1. Download the extension package from the this GitHub repository.
2. Extract the package to a folder on your computer.
3. Open your browser and navigate to the extensions page.
4. Enable developer mode if it is not already enabled.
5. Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the folder where you extracted the extension package.
6. The extension should now be installed and ready to use.

**How it works?**
The extension consists of a small control panel that is added below the question bar of ChatGPT.

It consists of 3 buttons: Mic button, Auto button and Sound button.

Mic button: This button turns on or off the microphone recording. When it is turned on, its color will turn red and everything you will say will be recorded, converted to text and added in the question bar. Turning it off, will reset to its original color and stop recording. _Using this button will listen until you stop speaking and then automatically turn itself off_

Auto button: This button will turn on auto microphone. In this mode, the microphone will not shut itself automatically when you stopped saying something, it will permanently keep the microphone on.

Sound button: This button turns on or off the Chat GPT response reading outloud. Turning this on will turn on the verbal capabilities of ChatGPT (reading the responses aloud). Having this off, ChatGPT will not orally respond to your inquiries.

**Limitations**
The extension currently only supports English language.
